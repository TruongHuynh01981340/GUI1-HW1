	<p>Striped bass is a saltwater fish that many considered a good eating fish
		and overall, a fun fish to catch. As a result, it's a popular game fish, which means it's highly regulated
		in order to maintain its population. So please take a look at the regulations before learning
		about how to catch it.</p>
	<h3>How to catch?</h3>
	<p>To catch a striped bass is quite straight forward. Striped bass mainly eat
		live bait like squids, so it's recommended to use natural bait. When you cast your line, wait until you line
		is getting tigher. This means that the fish got your bait, so reel the line in quickly. Remember to just reel
		and not
		strike the rod as circle hook only works by reeling. When the fish is near, net the fish and measure to make
		sure it's a legal fish to keep.</p>
	<h3>How to measure?</h3>
	<p>Measure striped bass from the tip of its snouth if its mouth is opened, jaw if its mouth is closed to the fartest
		part of
		the tail. Once you kept a legal sized fish, you can't discard it if you caught a bigger one.
