    <h3>Hook requirement</h3>
    <p>For all recreational anglers, it is a requirement to use <b>inline circle hook</b>
        when fishing for striped bass. This means that other hooks such as a J-hook or even offset
        circle hooks isn't allowed. However, this rule only applies when an angler is using whole or
        cut natural bait. The only exeception to the requirement is when utilizing artificial lure to
        catch striped bass.</p>

    <p>The main reason for requiring inline circle hook when targeting striped bass is there have
        been plenty of striped bass being released dead due to being gut hooked. As a result, inline circle
        hook is required since it will likely hook the corner jaw of the fish rather than it guts.</p>

    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>If you happened to gut-hook a striped bass while using an inline circle hook. Cut the leader of your
        fishing line as close to the hook as possible and leave the hook in the fish. The hook will eventually rust
        out and the fish will likely live.</p>
